#Test of Registration Form Page

## Overview
The main objective of this project is to thoroughly test the registration page.
This includes functional and non-functional testing. The testing process includes manual and automated testing.


##Features
There has been one automated test written for the purpose of testing the registration form page.
The test has been written in Java and Selenium Webdriver using Intellij. 
The test checks following:
- that the user can navigate to the page
- visibility of components
- text of some individual components like Page Title
- that information can be input into the correct boxes
- the registration form works and user can register their account
- that the buttons and drop-downs work as expected and are active

#### This test can be reused in order to check:
- log in page
- negative paths of the registration form
- any other form that requires filling in the information such as profile page

##ToDoList
This project is a work in progress. I have spent a lot of time just trying to set up the right environment and programs required for this project.
There are some parts that I have not done before, so they might not be as expected. However, I am willing to learn and really looking forward to getting experience in better documented projects comparing to my current work. 
If I had more time I would work further to receive status updated in my test since it breaks at some point and I do not know where.
I would also create some negative tests adding wrong formats and invalid data to see if the registration page stops me from registering.
